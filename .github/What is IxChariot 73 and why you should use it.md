## Key features of IxChariot 7.3
 
- It uses software agents called Performance Endpoints to generate and measure network traffic across thousands of network endpoints[^1^].
- It supports hundreds of protocols and applications, including wireless, cloud, IoT, VoIP, video streaming, and more[^1^]. You can also create your own custom scripts using the IxProfile tool.
- It provides a central console for easy management and analysis of test results. You can view key performance metrics such as throughput, packet loss, jitter, delay, MOS, and OTT video quality[^1^].
- It enables you to run "what-if" scenarios to predict the impact of network changes or new services on your network performance and quality of experience (QoE)[^1^].
- It supports both private virtual and public cloud infrastructures, as well as mobile, PC, Mac, and Linux platforms[^1^]. You can also use the XRPi Active Monitoring Probe to monitor remote locations[^2^].

## How to get started with IxChariot 7.3
 
If you want to try IxChariot 7.3 for yourself, you can download a free trial from the Keysight website[^1^]. You will need to install the IxChariot Console on a Windows machine and deploy Performance Endpoints on the devices or systems you want to test. You can also use the IxChariot Cloud service to access Performance Endpoints hosted on AWS or Azure[^1^]. Once you have set up your test environment, you can use the IxChariot Console to configure your test scenarios, run your tests, and view your results.
 
## Conclusion
